The 3-Dimensional (3D) Fuels study (SERDP Project RC19-1064) integrates field sampling, remote sensing, and 3D modeling to produce 3D fuels datasets for fire, fuels and smoke management mapping applications and wildland fire behavior and smoke modeling. Data collected for 18 sites across North America include raw, processed, and summarized voxel field data, forest floor field data, close-range Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) voxel datasets, TLS plot datasets, TLS unit datasets, Unmanned Aerial System SfM photogrammetry, and Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) datasets. 
Scripts in this repository are designed to be used within the workflows described in the methods documentation located in the data repository: Susan Prichard, & Eric Rowell.
